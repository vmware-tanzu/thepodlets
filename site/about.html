<p>Introducing The Podlets Podcast: A VMware audio guide to cloud native concepts.</p>

<p>
Cloud native technologies have unique elements. In the greater tech community, there is not only a lack of knowledge of concepts and certain technologies, but also misunderstanding and almost mysticism surrounding the space. The Podlets show aims to elucidate and demystify these elements to help people confidently embrace cloud native technology.
</p>

<p>
While The Podlets is accessible to newcomers, it’s not only for beginners. Advanced professionals will benefit from having a source of information that helps them keep up with the ever-evolving cloud native field. Because the cloud native space moves so quickly, no one has expert knowledge of every aspect of the ecosystem, and there’s lots of new terminology being introduced by developers. We will provide a well-rounded exploration of cloud native elements, patterns, use cases, and real-world experience in production environments.
